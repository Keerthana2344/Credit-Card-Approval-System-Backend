 To Dockerize the given Python code, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory and save the Python code in a file named `loan_management_system.py`.
2. Create a `requirements.txt` file in the same directory with the following content:
```
pandas
openpyxl
```
3. Create a `Dockerfile` in the same directory with the following content:
```sql
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY loan_management_system.py /app

CMD ["python", "loan_management_system.py"]
```
4. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the same directory with the following content:
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  loan_management_system:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/app
```
5. Run the following command in the terminal to build and run the Docker container:
```
docker-compose up
```
This will build the Docker image and run the container. The Python code will be executed inside the container and will print the output to the console.

Note: The `customer_id`, `loan_amount`, `interest_rate`, `tenure`, and `monthly_income` variables are not defined in the provided code, so you will need to provide their values in order to test the `create_loan` method.
